## Description

- This site is a timed JavaSript quiz.


### Prompts:
![Password Prompt](assets/images/password_prompt.png)

- When the generate password button is selected, this begins a series of window prompt questions in which the user can select the password's length, and what character types they wish to include. 

- If the user inputs a password length that is too short (less than 8 characters) or too long (over 128 characters) the password generator will prompt the user to try again. The same can be said in the instance where the user refuses to select a character type.

### Validation:
- When the user inuts the desired criteria, the password generator will produce a password that includes the desired length and character types. This password is generated within the text box of the page.
